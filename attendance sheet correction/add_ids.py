Notes:

This program was designed to be run from the command line with the file name of the attendance csv you want
to manipulate passed in, ie 'python3 add_ids.py Attendance_2018-10-27.csv'. If you don't specify a filename,
the program will ask you nicely once you boot it up, but this may be annoying as you won't be able to take
advantage of terminal autocomplete features.

Also, it expects a students.csv file to be present in the working directory, and students.csv needs to at
least have columns with students' First Name, Last Name, and Student Key.
