For jordan:

i'm currently writing the retrievebyHourAttendanceData function located in app/backend/views/reports.py (view for Reports model)

Pulling all records between a date range (abt a weeks worth) from dailyattendance table, I'd like this output returned from the function:

list of objs in this format:
{"date": yyyy-mm-dd, "time": ##:00:00, "num_visits": #}

one aggregate obj per date - rounded hour (rounded down) combination.

Basically I want django to count how many records there are per unique date - rounded hour combination.

** right now, to check the output of this reports/byHourAttendance?startdate=xxxxxx&enddate=xxxx , you can go to the reports tab of our site and it's being printed in the inspect console (thru react reports view).

(above requires date and time combined into one field though)
